  The format_check program will check the correctness of your output struct
file. Please use 'make' to compile the program as follows:

	make

  The Makefile is using 'gcc' to compile format_check.c. If you use other
compiler, ex. 'cc', rather than 'gcc', use the instruction as follows:

	make CC=cc

  When you have compiled the program, use the following instruction to read the
manu for this program:

	./format_check
	or ./format -help
