  The bench_gen is a program which can generate the test bench for your program.
The input number and the vector number are depend on the size of integer in your computer. For\n\
example, a 16-bit CPU system would have a maximum number 65535. Please use
'make' to compile the program as follows:

	make

  The Makefile is using 'gcc' to compile bench_gen.c. If you use other compiler,
ex. 'cc', rather than 'gcc', use the instruction as follows:

	make CC=cc

  When you have compiled the program, use the following instruction to read the
manu for this program:

	./bench_gen | more
	or ./bench_gen -help | more
